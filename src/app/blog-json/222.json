        "text": "On this day I was running my terminal output frantically. All difficulties converged - my tools were failing me and I really wished I could finish my tasks. Combined with lack of sleep from being a new dad, stress was setting in. I was fixing the tests, but my AI tool - 'Claude' - kept missing the ball, or dropping it completely. I was more than over relying on the tool. Putting code together is so tedious; AI was a welcome blessing for me. It could help me do that part of the job that I detested. For months I had been relying on it heavily to build a new platform. But now I was in dire straits, it was making a mess of everything. I just couldn't finish off a piece of work and fix these darn tests and that knot in my stomach that was so familiar to me had returned. it had returned to remind of how anal computers were.  High levels of concentration are needed to solve complex problems with software - sometimes I just don't have it, sometimes my mind just won't compute."

        "text": "Low and behold the numbers 221 and 222 started appearing in my tests output. Was it coinsedence? Of course, last time I was running the tests I may have considered that soon I would see these types of numbers, but I hadn't thought like that at all. I often see people ask about these numbers on the numerology forum on reddit. So what do they mean? On this particular occasion it was strange that I had hit that number of tests - as I began to spiral into misery. But was it a coincidence? Maybe if you chose to live life without imagination, then everything is a coincidence and very little has meaning. But to see the numbers on this particular day, and at this particular moment, meant something to me. The number 22 in the Tarot represents the end of the life cycle, both the beginning and the end, both 0 and 22. The Fools journey is the road of individuation, the path through life that is truly ideosynchratic. The path is crooked, it bends and twists and turns. Life isnt a straight line, sometimes you can't bend the world to your will. Both my long term partner and I have 21 and 22 as birth numbers, she is the Fool and I am the World. So when I see 221 or 222 it means something to me. It tells me that I am exactly where I need to be and that right now, in this moment, the universe that surrounds me is in perfect harmony around me."
