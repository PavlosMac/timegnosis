    "body": "Jupiter arrives like a monarch in motion—broad-shouldered, radiant, cloaked in wisdom and command. He does not knock; he enters. The atmosphere swells with his presence. This is the planet of expansion, of abundant force, of the soul’s appetite for greatness. When Jupiter touches a day, it becomes saturated with purpose. The air seems clearer, the vision sharper. Confidence rises—not as a boast, but as a birthright. You know who you are. You remember what you’re here to do. He is victory after long battle. He is the master finally recognized. He is the public figure, the honored voice, the leader crowned not by decree but by respect earned through trials. His days are filled with momentum and mastery—a surge forward, the strong grasping the helm. Under his gaze, success is not only possible, it is expected. But Jupiter is no gentle teacher. His gifts are immense, but so are his tests. For as swiftly as he raises, he can inflate. The line between vision and delusion, between esteem and ego, is thin—and Jupiter blurs it. Under his influence, one may mistake applause for virtue. One may chase the limelight not to enlighten, but to be admired. Beneath the golden glow, the hunger for validation festers. Power misused becomes tyranny; strength without compassion becomes cruelty. This is the shadow of the king: hubris, vanity, and disregard for those not applauding. When Jupiter dims, when his energy reverses or is misaligned, the sovereign withdraws. The hall is quiet. The fire flickers. Motivation wanes, and the grand vision that once lit the sky becomes a burden too heavy to carry. Where once there was clarity, now uncertainty clouds the path. The desire to lead dissolves into self-doubt, procrastination, or fear of being seen. Recognition evades you. Opportunities pass unclaimed. The body too may feel this contraction—strength replaced with fatigue, immunity faltering, spirit disoriented. This is not punishment, but a turning inward. A necessary retreat. Even Jupiter, god of thunder and justice, must descend from the throne to remember why he rules. And yet, even in his lowest expression, he never forgets your potential. Jupiter reminds you: greatness is not a performance—it is a responsibility. His energy expands what is within. If ego rules the heart, he will expand ego. But if virtue reigns, then Jupiter crowns it with lasting glory. He is the kingmaker and the truth-tester. The magnifier and the mirror. The force that asks: will you grow into your light, or be devoured by your own shadow?"
